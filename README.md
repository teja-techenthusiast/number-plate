Vehicle Number Plate Detection under Different Environmental Conditions - Machine Learning
This repository contains the code and documentation for a project focused on developing a robust vehicle number plate detection system capable of accurate operation under diverse environmental conditions.

# Project Description:
The project aims to develop an image processing system that can detect vehicle number plates accurately under various environmental conditions, such as varying lighting, different angles, and vehicle speeds. The system utilizes computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to achieve reliable number plate detection and recognition.

# Features:
- Detection of number plates under challenging environmental conditions.
- Preprocessing techniques including gray scaling, adaptive thresholding, and morphological operations.
- Feature extraction using edge detection and contour identification.
- Text extraction from the detected number plate region using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
- Evaluation of system performance using sample images under different conditions.

# Requirements:
- Python 3.9
- OpenCV 4.7.0
- NumPy 1.22.4
- Pytesseract 0.3.10

# Installation:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies mentioned above.
3. Run the main script to execute the number plate detection system.

# Usage:
- Ensure all sample images are placed in the designated directory.
- Run the main script to detect and extract number plates from the images.
- Evaluate the system's performance based on the provided output.
